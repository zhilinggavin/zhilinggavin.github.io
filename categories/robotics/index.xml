The robotic arm&amp;rsquo;s path planning and control were simulated and validated using MATLAB and CoppeliaSim.
The final evaluation was based on real-world performance during the Live Demonstration, where the project successfully achieved an 80% grade.
Assessment - Live Demonstration Task 1: Grab and Place Objective: Pick up a cube and accurately place it in a specified spot with a maximum error of 1mm.</description></item></channel></rss>
