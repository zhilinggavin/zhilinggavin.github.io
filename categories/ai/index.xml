Pulmonary fibrosis illustartion. Fibrosis can cause irreversible lung damage and is associated with increased mortality. Publication &amp;amp; Presentation This project was published at IEEE ISBI 2025 and featured as an invited presentation in April 2025, Houston, TX, USA.
Introduction Fibrotic Lung Disease (FLD) is a life-threatening condition characterised by progressive lung scarring, responsible for 1% of UK deaths in 2021. However, fibrosis appears in irregular and diffuse patterns with poorly defined boundaries, making manual segmentation highly variable and labor-intensive.</description></item><item><title>Auto Lung Anatomy Segmentation</title><link>https://zhilinggavin.github.io/project/auto-lung-segmentation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhilinggavin.github.io/project/auto-lung-segmentation/</guid><description>Automatic Lung segmentation Introduction The automatic segmentation of the lung region in chest X-rays (CXR) aids doctors in diagnosing various lung diseases. However, severe lung deformities and indistinct lung boundaries caused by serious conditions can lead to errors in the segmentation model.
Data and task description Dataset consists of collected from public available chest X-Ray (CXR) images. Overall amount of images is 800 meanwhile labeled only 704 of them. Whole dataset was randomly divided into train (0.</description></item><item><title>Explainable AI - Controlable Image Generation</title><link>https://zhilinggavin.github.io/project/explanable-ai/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhilinggavin.github.io/project/explanable-ai/</guid><description>Introduction This project investigates semantic disentanglement techniques to analyse the intermediate latent spaces in generative AI models, such as StyleGAN and Diffusion models. By isolating and utilising these disentangled features, we aim to develop prognostic models for lung diseases that are more interpretable for clinicians and researchers. This approach will facilitate the identification of novel biomarkers for lung disease prognosis. The detailed project in medical domain can be found in the poster.</description></item><item><title>Evaluating Generative AI: GAN-Based Models</title><link>https://zhilinggavin.github.io/project/evaluate-genai/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zhilinggavin.github.io/project/evaluate-genai/</guid><description> GAN-based Generative AI Evaluation Conducted an in-depth evaluation of state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their applications. Assessed model performance through benchmarking, analysing factors such as image quality, training stability, and computational efficiency. Explored advancements in GAN architectures and their practical implementations across various domains.
