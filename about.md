# About Me

Hello, I’m **Gavin (Zhiling) Yue**, a Machine Learning Engineer and Technology Cooperation
Coordinator based in Europe. I work across **AI research, university partnerships, and applied
machine learning**, helping to connect strong academic ideas with practical, real-world uses.

My interests include:

- Machine learning and generative AI  
- AI for science, education, and policy  
- Building and managing university–industry collaborations  


I enjoy creating structure in complex projects, simplifying communication between different
stakeholders, and turning ideas into concrete outcomes.

## Outside Work

Outside work, I’m developing a personal brand that combines:

- AI and data thinking  
- Real estate insight and on-the-ground experience  
- A healthy, sustainable lifestyle centred around yoga and self-awareness  

I live with my wife, Chuanzhi, and we are gradually building a life that balances career, learning,
and exploration.
