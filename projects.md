# Projects

This is a selection of projects and areas I’m involved in. I’ll expand this over time with
more detail, links, and technical notes.

## AI & Machine Learning

### AI for Medical Imaging  
A project involving generative or deep learning methods for medical image analysis and
decision support. Focused on model performance, reliability, and potential clinical impact.

- **Keywords:** PyTorch / deep learning / generative models  
- **Type:** Research & applied ML  

### AI for Science & Education – White Paper  
Ongoing work exploring how AI can support science education, including policy landscapes in
the UK/EU, classroom-level use cases, and responsible implementation.

- **Keywords:** AI for education / policy / strategy  
- **Type:** Analysis, writing, and stakeholder mapping

## Collaboration & Technology Cooperation

Work with universities and research partners on joint AI projects, including:

- Scoping and structuring collaboration topics  
- Coordinating Statements of Work (SoWs), charters, and milestones  
- Connecting internal R&D with external academic expertise  

This side of my work focuses on building **trust, clarity, and long-term relationships** between
research groups and industry labs.

## Real Estate & Data

I am also exploring:

- London property from a **value and liveability** point of view  
- How data and judgement can support better buying and investment decisions  
- Content and education around property for international and local buyers  

Over time, this section will include case studies, notes from viewings, and frameworks I use to
think about property.

## Future Directions

Some directions I’m considering developing further:

- Public-facing content on AI for science & education  
- Simple tools or dashboards combining AI + property data  
- Educational content around financial planning and lifestyle design
